TO DO

There is a better way to store photos. That way is Cloudinary. The setup is pretty easy.
Another thing is Heroku - the setup is not that hard and this project can migrate pretty
easy to using the free PostgreSQL provided by the platform, because my repositories don't
have any custom queries.

Maybe in the future I can implement those features and use this project in a job interview...
